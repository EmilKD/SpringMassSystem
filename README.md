# An implicit Euler mass-spring system simulator 
This is a practice project for learning more about mass-spring systems and the implicit Euler solver. 
The visualization of the simulator is done using an OpenGL project i'd developed earlier.

## Here's a short demo of the mass-spring system

## Dependencies
The following libraries and files should be placed in a folder named 'Libraries' in the project path:
GLFW: 
```
./Libraries/lib/glfw3.lib
./Libraries/Include/GLFW/[GLFW built headers]
./Libraries/Include/glm/[glm build headers]
./Libraries/Include/glad[glad build headers]
./Libraries/glad.c
./Libraries/stb_image.h
```
